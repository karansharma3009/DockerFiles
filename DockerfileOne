# manually try to run the Image in docker and check if two options are coming on runing alternatives --config java -- this wil fail your docker connection and your agent will be offline always due to compatibility issues  of JRE .
# in my case i was running JENKINS 2.4 ( which runs on JDK11 ) and was including CentOS7 in dockerfile for docker container - which includes jdk8 . 
# even on adding  RUN   yum install -y java-11-openjdk-devel -- JDK was not getting updated to 11 Java run time .
